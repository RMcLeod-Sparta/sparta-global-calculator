## Work structure

I went through the tasks in the order were presented using the if, else if, else and switch statements where nessisary, also providing alternate inputs for the user to select the option they wanted.

I googled the operands for the functions I did not know how to program and applyed them to the variables appropriatly. The only one I had trouble with was addition where I need to convert the numbers given as strings into numbers variable for use with the "+" opperator.

Finnally I did the BMI task with relative ease by looking up the proper conversions and asking for the values in pounds and inches for impirical, kilograms and meters for metric.
